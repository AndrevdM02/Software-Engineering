## Goal of this scheduler.

This program is a Scheduler, that assigns modules, available at given times, to venues if their available times match. The program takes in a text file containing all the modules, with their available times and a text file containing all of the venues containing their given times.

## Inputs that the program needs

1. A list of the modules that contains; the name of the lecturer, the name of the building, the name of the faculty that runs this module, the code of the module, the number of students enrolled in the module and then each day of the week, followed by their available times.

2. A list of the venues that contains; the name of the building, the room/lecture hall of the building, the size of the venue and then each day of the week, followed by their available times.

3. The path and name of the new file to be generated.

Using these input paramaters, we can assign each module to a venue once a day and using the faculty, we can assure that any student that has multiple modules, won't have any time table clashes, as their classes for two or more modules won't be scheduled on the exact same time.

## Output generated by the program

1. A text file with the path and name given by the third command line argument, that contains a list of venues and modules scheduled to a specific day and time.

## How to run the algorithm

This is a schedular java program that can be tested by doing the following
steps:

1. cd into the Scheduling directory
2. run mvn compile in your terminal
3. run mvn package in your terminal
4. run mvn test in your terminal

## Results

This build tool creates a new file in Scheduling/src/main/java/resources directory,
containing a schedule of all the venues and modules that was used in the input
as well as a few text files with errors caused by using an empty file.

## Coverage

I set out to implement code coverage, to measure the degree to which the source code of the program is executed when I run my unit tests. My program has a high test coverage score of 98%, meaning that almost all of of the programns sorce code has been executed during the tests. When the gitlab pipeline has finished executing, it generates an index.html page (see link at the top of the document), that contains the coverage score of this program. Since the program coverage score is so high, it has a very low chance of containing undetected software bugs.

## Coverage report

To access the coverage report from the Pages link above (gitlab's pages), you need to click on the link and then add /coverage-report at the end of the URL. There is also a link in the table above that will take you directly to the report.

## Mutation

I set out to implement mutation testing in this project, as mutation testing creates faults/mutations that are automatically seeded into my code, and then my tests are run. If the tests fail then the mutations is killed,if your tests pass then the mutation lived. The quality of my tests can be gauged fromthe percentage of mutations killed. To create these mutations in my code, I used PIT, that automatically generated mutations into my code and then ran my unit tests against the mutated project. After doing this, I saw that my mutation score ended up being 75%. 150 mutations has been added into my code and of this 150 mutations, 113 of them was killed. The mutations with out coverage came out to have a score of 79%.
